**preprocessingCodeLang.py** 
---
This is initial preprocessing script. We preprocess code and language separately. 

**INPUT:** This script will take four xml files for each project - "birt.xml","eclipse.xml","eclipse-jdt.xml" and "swt.xml". This four xml files should be put in the same directory as the script while execution. 

**OUTPUT:** This script will generate different txt files for each post in above four xml files. The project name is appended at the front in txt file's name to differentiate between different projects.
